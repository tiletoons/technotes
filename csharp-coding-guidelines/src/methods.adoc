== Methods

Every method should be preceded by a documentation comment explaining the purpose
of the method:

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Handles the <see cref="DetectTemperature"/> event.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="sender">
/// The <see cref="Probe"/> that generated the event.
/// </param>
/// <param name="args">
/// A <see cref="DetectTemperatureEventArgs"/> that contains the last detected
/// temperature.
/// </param>
private void OnDetectTemperature(
    Object sender, DetectTemperatureEventArgs args)
{
  ...
}
```

Parameter names should be explicit, especially if they are integers or Booleans:

```cs
public void DetectTemperatureEventArgs(int i)
{
    // Avoid
}

public void DetectTemperatureEventArgs(int temperature)
{
    // OK
}
```

Of course, for very generic methods, short parameter names may be more appropriate:

```cs
public static void Sort(int[] i)
{
    // OK
}
```

Methods should have at most 30 lines of code. The method header, comments, blank
lines, and lines containing only braces are not included in this count. Methods
that consist of one long `if`-`else` or `switch` may be longer, provided each
branch in 10 lines or fewer. This rule forces to break up complex computations
into separate methods.
