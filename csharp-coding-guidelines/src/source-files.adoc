== Source Files

Source files should be kept as short as possible. Put every class in a separate
file, and name that file like the class followed by the `.cs` extension.

For each assembly, create a new directory named like the assembly itself, and
inside each assembly directory, map namespaces one-to-one to the directory layout
For example, namespace `Thermota.Core.Properties` in assembly `Termota.Core`
should be mapped to directory `Thermota.Core`.

Organize the material in each source file as follows:

1. file header
2. `using` statements
3. `namespace` statement, if appropriate
4. A `class`, `struct`, or `enum`

The file header should at least include the file name, begin date, author, and
copyright notice:

```cs
//+ <source name="Thermometer.cs" language="C#" begin="17-_Feb-2021">
//+ <author href="mailto:j3d@tiletoons.com">J3d</author>
//+ <copyright year="2021">
//+ <holder web="https://tiletoons.com">Tiletoons!</holder>
//+ </copyright>
//+ <legalnotice>All rights reserved.</legalnotice>
//+ </source>
```
